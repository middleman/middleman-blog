  Scenario: Collection pages are accessible from the preview server
    Given the Server is running at "custom-collections-app"
    When I go to "/categories/ruby-on-rails.html"
    Then I should see "/2011-01-01-new-article.html"
    Then I should not see "/2011-01-02-another-article.html"
    When I go to "/categories/html5.html"
    Then I should not see "/2011-01-01-new-article.html"
    Then I should see "/2011-01-02-another-article.html"
    When I go to "/index.html"
    Then I should see "Category Path: '/categories/ruby-on-rails.html'"

  Scenario: Collection pages are accessbile from preview server with directory_indexes
    Given a fixture app "custom-collections-app"
    And app "custom-collections-app" is using config "directory-indexes"
    And the Server is running

    Then I should see "File Not Found"
    When I go to "/categories/ruby-on-rails"
    Then I should not see "/2011-01-01-new-article.html"
    Then I should see "/2011-01-01-new-article"

    | categories.html |

    And the file "categories/ruby-on-rails.html" should contain "Category: ruby-on-rails"

      """
